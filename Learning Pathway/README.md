# Learning Pathway Repository for STREAM Education

Welcome to the Learning Pathway Repository! This repository is part of the larger STREAM Education initiative and is organized according to the STREAM Framework Sitemap. It is designed to guide educators, curriculum developers, and researchers in implementing effective, interdisciplinary learning pathways.

## üåü Overview

This repository serves as a hub for a series of documents that outline various learning pathways under the STREAM (Science, Technology, Reading, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) framework. The materials are designed to:
- Provide structured, actionable guidance for integrating STREAM principles into classroom practices.
- Showcase innovative projects and curricula that bridge technical skills with creativity and literacy.
- Foster collaboration and continuous improvement in educational practices.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on the STREAM Framework Sitemap. As a starting point, the first document is:

- **Integrated STREAM Robotics Learning Pathway for K12 Segment**  
  This document outlines a structured pathway to introduce robotics through the STREAM lens, engaging young learners in both hardware and software creativity. It serves as a model for integrating interdisciplinary STEM/Arts education in K12 environments.

> **Note:** Additional documents and learning pathways will be added over time, each aligned with different segments of the STREAM Framework as indicated in the [STREAM Framework Sitemap](./Sitemap).

### Planned Documents

Other documents that will be developed and added include (but are not limited to):
- Competency-Based Assessment Framework for Modern STREAM Learning
- Empowering Educators: A Comprehensive Guide to Implementing STREAM Education
- Comparative Analysis of Integrated STREAM vs. Traditional STEM/Technical Education
- Additional learning pathways and supplementary resources

## üîç How to Use These Resources

- **Educators & Curriculum Developers:**  
  Use the provided learning pathway documents as blueprints for developing interdisciplinary curricula and lesson plans that incorporate STREAM principles.
  
- **Researchers:**  
  Dive into the frameworks and methodologies to explore best practices and innovative approaches in integrated education.

- **Community Contributors:**  
  We welcome your contributions! Share your improvements, suggestions, or additional learning pathways. Please refer to our [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file for details on how to get involved.
