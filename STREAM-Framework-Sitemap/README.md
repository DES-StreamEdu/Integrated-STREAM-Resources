# STREAM Education Open Source Repository üöÄüìö

Welcome to the STREAM Education Open Source Repository! This repository is dedicated to providing a comprehensive collection of resources that support educators, curriculum developers, and researchers in implementing integrated STREAM (Science, Technology, Reading/Research, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) education. Our vision is to continuously evolve and improve these materials based on community feedback and emerging best practices.

## üåü Overview

This repository is organized according to the STREAM Framework Sitemap. It includes a series of documents, learning pathways, and guides that together create a cohesive educational ecosystem. Our current plan is to provide key foundational resources, with future alterations and improvements planned to expand and refine our offerings.

**Current Key Resources:**
- **Integrated STREAM Robotics Learning Pathway for K12 Segment:**  
  A structured pathway to introduce robotics through the STREAM lens, engaging young learners in both hardware and software creativity.
- **Competency-Based Assessment Framework (CBAF) for Modern STREAM Learning:**  
  A framework that provides practical strategies and rubrics for assessing essential STREAM competencies.
- **Empowering Educators: A Comprehensive Guide to Implementing STREAM Education:**  
  A guide designed to help educators integrate STREAM concepts into their classrooms with actionable strategies and best practices.
- **Comparative Analysis of Integrated STREAM vs. Traditional STEM/Technical Education:**  
  An in-depth analysis highlighting the strengths and challenges of integrated STREAM approaches compared to traditional models.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

The repository is organized based on our STREAM Framework Sitemap. Current folders include:
- **/STREAM-Learning-Framework**  
  Contains foundational whitepapers and overarching vision documents.
- **/Competency-Based-Assessment-Framework**  
  Houses the CBAF document and assessment tools.
- **/Empowering-Educators**  
  Includes comprehensive guides and practical resources for educators.
- **/Comparative-Analysis**
